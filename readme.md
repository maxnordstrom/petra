# Max Nordström - Work sample for Petra Agency

This site is built using HTML5 boilerplate and Twitter Bootstrap.

For the front-end I've used HTML, JavaScript and CSS, and for the back-end PHP and MySQL.

## The site

A site displaying a table with available products. The start page **petra/** will print out all products. Subpages with category, for e.g. **petra/sport/** will filter the products with category sport. Navigate to a specific product by entering for e.g. **petra/sport/elcykel-allegro/**

Navigate to **petra/admin** to access an admin view. Here you can edit any product values, and when clicking the button **Uppdatera** the database will be updated.

## Local environment

I've set up this project using MAMP. Put the project folder in your root directory (in my case **htdocs**), and import the original database which is located in the **database folder**. Database name is **petra_db**
