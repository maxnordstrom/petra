# Max Nordstr√∂m - Work sample for Petra Agency

This site is built using html5 boilerplate and bootstrap.

For the front-end I've used HTML, JavaScript and CSS, and for the back-end PHP and MySQL.

## The site

A site displaying a table with available products. The start page **petra/** will print out all products. Subpages with category, for e.g. **petra/sport/**, will filter the products with category sport. Navigate to a specific product by entering for e.g. **petra/sport/elcykel-allegro/**.
